# Analysis and Design of NUnit

This repo contains models and sketches related to the NUnit project.

The models are meant to illustrate parts of the NUnit project, and are not meant to be complete or fully up-to-date.  We will create these when a sketch/model/diagram is needed for a discussion or a document.
